    <h2>lore</h2>
        <p>It all started a few months ago when I was going on ycombinator reading random people's websites, and I would sometimes be critical of them, noticing minor details, things that annoyed me. Then I realized that I too have a website, I went on it and it kind of pissed me off how bad it was, of course it was my first time ever trying to do something like that, I felt some pride, but I couldn't look at it like it was my own son, it was a pre-made layout, with some decent features which were pretty much just copy and pasted from w3schools or elsewhere.</p>
    <p>I also thought of making my own template, but when I got to it, I was comparing my empty css file to over a thousand lines of css which made it seem impossible. Only recently did I realize that I could make something that I like with as little as 7 lines of css (8 with font), thanks to <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a></p>
    <pre>
      <p>
        body{
          margin:40px auto;
          max-width:650px;
          line-height:1.6;
          font-size:18px;
          color:#444;
          padding:0 10px;
          font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
        }
      </p>
    </pre>
        <p>So I started with a basic html page with those 7 lines of css, and built on it, changed the font, and remembered that a friend suggested to show some of my pictures off somewhere, so I also added that and ran into my first predicament which was a gallery to show off pictures. I got this idea from Paulie B's website, I saw it a few months ago and kept it on the back burner for awhile, a side scrolling gallery, neat.</p>
  
    <pre>
      <p>
        img {
          height: min(35vw, 550px);
          max-width: none;
          width: auto;
        }
        .scrl {
          display:flex;
          overflow-x:auto;
          width: 100vw;
          margin-left: -50vw;
          left:50%;
          position: relative;
        }
      </p>
    </pre>
      <p>Turns out it's pretty simple, and it even scales according to screen size which I was doing semi-automatically on my previous CSS file, which I just went and checked, in its entirety had 505 lines which I personally wrote or copy and pasted from somewhere, doesn't even make sense. </p>
      <p>Only recently did I realize that I have a passion for making things as small and efficient as I could make them, so seeing this change is pretty abismal, it's not like the performance was bad but I just wanted to make it better. Those features like the navigation bar, the click-to-change gallery, and css animations were really fun to play with and satisfying to have them finally work though.</p>
