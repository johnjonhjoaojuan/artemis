      <h1>home page, welcome!</h1>
        <h3>what is going on here</h3>
    </header>

      <p>website for projects, be it writing, photography, or this website, something neat which doesn't have a proper direction just yet</p>
    <br>
    <h2> Overhaul project</h2>
      <p>My plan for this version 2 of the website is to re-start this project, adding features, or removing ones which don't align with my goals, while trying things I've thought of or enjoyed looking at when exploring the internet</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Keep the website small and efficient while maintaining decent aesthetics, also can't forget to give it some character;</li>
          <li>Go for performance and comfort/ease of use</li>
          <li>Practice coding, discover tricks, go in depth into coding and all of that.</li>
          <li>By having less stuff that i'm unhappy with on this website, i'll most likely update it from time to time</li>
        </ul>

    <p>I also want to add a section for each thing/hobby, like photography, writing, or general projects like the website, or random side-quests that I happen to run upon.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p> 24 of July 2025 - first website with placeholder text, and ideas laid out like the sections</p>
    <p> 01 of August 2025 - Added side scroll gallery on photography section</p>
    <p> 07 of August 2025 - Started writing "jonh v2"</p>
